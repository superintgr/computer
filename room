room : <dimensions>
response : {functions of (input)/(output)}
gate : [fixed window for realizing state of room]

1. Room is a structured environment with gates for entering and existing.
2. Upon entering the class, the methods of the environment type determines what variable transformation is possible.
3. For every changes introduced to the static state, the corresponding reaction via room parameters to the room response function calculates the observable variables.
4. The room has always some reflective behavior profile, but the observables collected via instrument depends on the medium and physical laws.
