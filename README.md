1. There are several ways for a source node to get to some target antinodes. (spectrum)
2. A system that conserves energy across an array of nodes and antinode pairs, must maintain the stationary distribution pattern (transformer)
3. Constructors can enter a room which is a finite medium with spatial-temporal coordinate system and constructors that represent the transformations of others with respect to itself. (spectrum, transformer, room)
