import necessary

## Required features:
# 1. creating child processes
# 2. communicating with other processes
# 3. setting pipeline for running distributed tasks
# 4. be able to go offline with checkpoint
# 5. staying online for error correction
# 6. implementing scheduled operations
# 7. optimization subject to constraints
# 8. supervision of code execution

## Example use:

env = Environment("env")
agent = Agent("agent")

env.prepare_task(config)
env.set_computer(agent)
agent.set_construction(config)

state = env.get_state()
measure = state[task] @ agent(state).T


# environment prepares a set of observables based on configuration of task dataset provided
# setting the computer for transforming observables to other valid construction task is specified
# agent is a recurrent neural network model which samples the observation points inside the environment
# specific channel is registered for tracing the path of agent computations
# agent is prepared for probing phase and parameters are set to learnable modes
# after finite period, the state of the environment is sampled
# measurement is applied to the system for joint compatibility criteria
# more tasks and agents could be introduced under the same structure
