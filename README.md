1. There are several ways for a source node to get to some target antinodes. (spectrum)
2. A system that conserves energy across an array of nodes and antinode pairs, must maintain the stationary distribution pattern (transformer)
3. Constructors can enter a room which is a finite medium with spatial-temporal coordinate system and constructors that represent the transformations of others with respect to itself. (spectrum, transformer, room)
4. Refer to the phonon note for the next discussion materials,

[discussion] -> approximation to a constructor whose production causes novel algorithm for making the most wealth possible.

"->" : direction that causes one way change with respect to connecting notes.
For example, -> should result in a constructor whose repetoire consists of all possible transformations that endows one with necessary knowledge of the process, the wealth that it is a constructor of. Then I shall set the left side with the constructor of abstract type that transforms along with all my other possesions the ones that could include the expected wealth and the task requires it to be carrying out all of the required operations.

(providing resource) because no process may randomly connect the something specific and determine something deterministic. therefore just like the extraction of work requires an exact law of change, the changable quantity must also be specifiable before the change is expected. additionally, look at the principle of conservation or any other physical law if conflicted.

(retaining resource) collecting the token of change which redirects measurable quantities to another measurable quantity is the redirection of resource from deterministic process of change appearing at the determined location where change is possible.

(abstract constructor) just from the set of possible constructors it is possible to transform the stated substrate via their characteristic algorithms but the knowledge is the key determinant of whether the task as a whole be found executable at one time or not since a directed knowledge about possible transformations in nature given the requisite mind (ideally), it must also recieve the directed change from specific states where one of many things are gradually transformed into all of one thing where the best possible knowledge of the task and the constructor is expected to bring about the best possible associtions at which some other best possible task would become one of the abstract constructor for the subsequent tasks from the same kind of universes.

For example, a bank account can hold fundable dollars but the dollars are only fundable upto the legal systems behind the dollar constructor is allowed to bring about the possible set of constructions through its associations between banks and banks with sellers/buyers fulfilling the information and computation criteria with their substrates in between the transformations.

But the legal system behind the dollar is not a substrate whose knowledge would provide sufficient permutations that could utilize the laws of physics in seeking the transformations that mutates the states of all such bank accounts over the abstract constructors that would be in possessions of the buyers and sellers. Also there may not be the required level of knowledge in the libraries of intermediate users since their abstractor constructors would each be have to in possessions of all dependend constructions in check from which the current task on money is going to be possible. If suddenly money constructor changes by the magnitude that makes vast arrays of composite constructors defined over objective regularities upto the present task whose regular nature is problematic, this should imply that the laws of physics changes by the factor of equal magnitude in each instances of physical change, therefore it must be dealt in seperate grounds first.

[physical vs logical]

- states of a computer, programs from a state
- state of a program, computers from a program
- program of a computer, bits from a substrate
- programs of a state, gates from a algorithm

gate -> physical set, logical path -> algorithm
algorithm -> state, gate -> state
computer -> state, logic -> program
program -> state, logic -> algorithm
state -> computer, state + program -> algorithm, program

program defines abstractly what states the algorithmic process could instruct the computer
if the computer is prepared with the state required by the program and is capable of reaching the state specified then the instruction brings current to another state
when the brought change is defined as consequence of the operations and the program expects the output the further process of information on the data is possible deterministically.

The algorithm must then become resilient kn ensuring the execution process such that one of the other instruction could then be reachable no matter what path the process of getting there is required by the computer.

Typical gates are tables containing binary values as incoming current and outgoing current altering or not blocking the incoming voltage potential via induced current from one or more available sources.

Just like a voltmeter which measures the difference at one of the point along a conducting path of electrical current, the gates are also a measuring instrument which realizes the current passing through certain component capable of losslessly redirecting the flow of electrons passively.
